# VEILNET

Quantum-safe decentralized communication network.

## What is VEILNET?

VEILNET is the first open-source communication network built for the post-quantum era. No servers. No identity. No trust required.

## Why?

RSA and ECC encryption will be broken by quantum computers. VEILNET uses ML-KEM-1024 (NIST FIPS 203) — the new quantum-safe standard.

## Status

🔬 Early development — v0.1.0

## Built with

- Rust
- liboqs (Open Quantum Safe)
- ML-KEM-1024
